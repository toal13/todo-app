# Todo app with spaghetti code
This project aims to demonstrate good practices in React development by presenting a functional but poorly written project. 
The purpose is to showcase knowledge of good practices by refactoring the code according to principles and guidelines from "Clean Code." The main idea is to break down the principles and guidelines, apply them to the existing codebase, and explain the changes through comments. Additionally, suggestions for further improvements will be provided.
